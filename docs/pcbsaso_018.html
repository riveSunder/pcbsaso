      Cryptic phenotypes can be triggered by environmental conditions. Helmet expresison in <em>Daphnia</em> can be induced by presence of predators. From (<a href='https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/behavioral-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2018.00330/full'>Weiss 2019</a>).

    I am interested in <strong>integrating the concept of existential forcing found in DWs in systems capable of intrinsic evolution</strong>, or looking for intrinsic evolution in DaisyWorld-type models. <br><br> <strong>But</strong> we shouldn't lose sight of ethical considerations of building systems <a href='https://poets.org/poem/memoriam-h-h'>red in tooth in claw</a> that may contain entities capable of suffering (<em>e.g.</em> see <a href='https://gregegan.net/PERMUTATION/FAQ/FAQ.html'>Egan <~2007</a>, <a href='https://gregegan.net/MISC/CRYSTAL/Crystal.html'>Egan 2008</a>).<br><br>
