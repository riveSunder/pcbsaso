      HARLI's hack was more general than typical spaceships as well. HARLI was evolved with rules B3/S023 (DotLife), B3/S236, B3/S237, B3/S238, and evaluated with Life itself (B3/S23). The lightweight spaceship (struggling above) only works in 2 of these rule sets, but the wave strategy <span title='HARLI also learned to take advantage of a _reset environment_ signal, which allowed it to score rewards higher than possible for c-speed motility'>works in all of them</span>.
